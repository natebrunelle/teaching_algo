      <h1 data-number="1" id="purpose" data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Purpose</h1>
      <p>Your first peer evaluation is to occur after your week 3 assessed meeting and before your week 4 prep meeting. You will evaluate all cohort-members (including yourself) on 5 items. Each item will have 4 options: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, room for improvement, unsatisfactory. The chart describes example behaviors to merit each category. Select the best fit.</p>
      <p>Your responses will be aggregated, anonymized and then shared with the cohort-mate whom they’re about. This exercise is nothing more than your first opportunity to express and document feedback, and will not directly impact your cohort-mates’ grades. Our goals are two-fold: 1) To let your cohort-mates know how they’re doing in order to offer encouragement or to provide them opportunity to correct shortcomings, and 2) to help the course staff record how things are going and highlight where they might need to intervene or recognize exceptional performers.</p>
      <p>To make sure everyone has an opportunity to grow as a student and as a team player, please do not assess someone more favorably than they deserve. We do not want to be in a situation where someone is under-contributing throughout the semester, is consistently told they’re doing well, but then is suddenly informed that they have not been doing well for months. A little discomfort now will save a lot of discomfort later.</p>
      <p>Complementary to that, if you are assessed poorly, try not to be offended or embarrassed. We encourage you to earnestly consider the feedback and then engage in conversation with your cohort-mates. It could be that your cohort-mates’ expectations of you are set too high, it could be that you’re contributing in ways that your cohort-mates have thus far failed to recognize, or it could be that there is legitimately room for improvement on your end. Whatever the case, the best way to proceed is to communicate. Professor Brunelle is happy to help you to figure out how to start this conversation if you’d like.</p>
