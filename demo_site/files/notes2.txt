Recommendation for the cheat sheet
One proof strategy
Things that the professor wants me to know is not strictly def
 

 

How to show a set is uncountable
Def of uncountable
A is uncountable |A| > |N|
Two strategies
Diagonalization
Mapping(injection, etc)
Mapping example(easier to use than diagonalization)
3d in the practice exam
I have any natural number of scoops. Each scoop is one of |N| flavors
Want to show that this is uncountable
Solution:
 

Take a set B that I know is uncountable
If I can find f: B --> A such that f is one-to-one, then |A| >= |B|
Or the mapping is onto(A --> B)
 

Set that is uncountable: set of all infinitely long binary strings --> we are gonna call this B
C will be the set of all icecream scoops
Find f: B --> C s.t. diff strings yield diff cones(I think he means scoop when he says cones)
 

B1 = 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 …

B2 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 …

 

0 = vanilia

1 = 1 chocolate

 

If bit I is 1 then scoop I is chocolate, 0 --> vanilia

 

How to know that different string gives different cones
--> because the order is important --> there will be a bit somewhere that will be diff

Let bit j be where they differ
The cones will have a different flavors at scoop j so the cones are different
So we have the injection between the infinitely long binary string and the scoops of ice cream so the set of scoops is uncountable
