If you enrolled into the course late, here's what you need to get started

# Course Structure

  All students will assigned to cohorts of other students to work with throughout the semester. These cohorts will meet twice weekly: first to discuss problem sets and course content with each other, then to present their solutions and show what they know to their TA. Live meetings will not happen, with the twice-weekly cohort meetings taking their place. You can find details about the course structure in the "Course Structure" tab of this webpage.

## Weekly Tasks

Here's what you'll be expected to do throughout each week:

- **Before your first cohort meeting**: Watch provided instructional videos, read provided instructional text, attempt weekly problem sets, attend office hours to improve understanding when necessary
- **During your first cohort meeting**: Discuss (potentially incomplete or incorrect) solutions with the cohort. Collaborate and converge on the best answer you can muster for each problem.
- **Between your cohort meetings**: Review solutions from the first weekly cohort meeting to ensure you understand them. Seek clarification from your cohort-mates or office hours when necessary. Refine solutions if necessary.
- **During your second cohort meeting**: Do your best to provide solutions when called-upon by the TA. The TA will ask each student to attempt at least one problem, and may ask follow-up or clarification questions to more accurately assess understanding.
- **After your second cohort meeting**: Complete and submit your problem writeup.

# To-Do List for new enrollees:

1. [Watch the first class meeting](https://virginia.zoom.us/rec/share/tubu-yjAN6LFnLKiaAytsxip7PygYTBCcZe6UocHLFTytSt8ISa_pjGnCqpTOgqG.9QfI_Oa05uTC-UxA?startTime=1612295995000): We had one full-class meeting on the first day of classes. This will be the only class meeting of the semester. We discussed motivations behind the study of theory, and went over the course structure.
1. Join the Course Discord (link in collab): Pretty much everything this semester will be run through discord (cohort meetings, course announcements, office hours, etc.)
1. Send an email or Discord message to Professor Brunelle to let him know you've joined. He'll need to update the course rosters before you can continue to the next steps.
1. Get Verified in Discord: After you click the invite link in collab and join our Discord, you will be messaged by our bot named "Turing". Respond to Turing with your computing id to get verified in the course.
1. Provide as many options as you can for cohort times using [this tool](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory/cohort_times.php)
1. Let Professor Brunelle know you've provided times and he'll assign a cohort
1. Introduce yourself to you cohort
1. Start learning! [Week 1](week1.html), [Week 2](week2.html)
