      <p><img src=files/images/tas/nate.jpg height="300" ></p>
      <p>I’m Nate Brunelle (left). I’m originally from Virginia Beach, VA, where I attended Ocean Lakes High School. Throughout Quarantine my fiancee, Sarah, and I have mostly been gardening, redecorating and reorganizing the house, and doing a lot of cooking. Please introduce yourself, I can’t wait to meet you!</p>

      <p>Hey, I’m Megan! I’m a 4th year computer science major and this is my second time as a TA for 3102. I was born in Wisconsin but grew up in Winchester, VA with four younger siblings. When I’m not working I like to do crafts like cross-stitch and making friendship bracelets! I also like to write on the side so I hope that one day I’ll be able to write books alongside a software engineering job!</p>

      <p><img src=files/images/tas/brandon_bremer.jpeg height="300" ></p>
      <p>Hey, I’m Brandon. I was born in the USA but my earliest memories are of Germany where my family was stationed, I attended a German kindergarten and got to travel around Europe but honestly I barely remember it because we moved back by the time I was seven. I really enjoy working on puzzles, mostly jigsaw and crosswords and have been doing a lot of them as well as reading while trapped inside this past year. I’m hoping to get a chance to travel to Greece and Italy once it is safe to travel again, when I am not taking computer science and math courses I am invariably taking something from the classics department and highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a break from the numbers!</p>

      <p>Hello! I’m Rachel. In my spare time, I love to workout and sing. I recently started learning how to play a guitar. It is harder than I thought, but I think I got the hang of it. I want to play 2002 by Anne-Marie when I get better!</p>

He is the founder, CEO, CTO and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.

      <p><img src=files/images/tas/ethan.jpg height="300" ></p>
      <p>Hey! My name is Ethan Gahm and I’m a second year Computer Science major from Boston, Massachusetts. I took CS 3102 in the fall semester and LOVED it, and I can’t wait to help introduce some of you to the wonderful world of theoretical computer science. Outside of my classes, I’m a member and executive of the club table tennis team here at UVA (which has unfortunately gone rather dormant due to Covid). I also love to get outdoors. I was quite active in the Outdoors Club last year and plan to do a lot of hiking this spring as soon as the weather is sufficiently warm. Through CS 3102 this semester, I hope not only to help teach the course material, but to solidify my own understanding of key topics, and to engage more deeply with a set of subject matter which I find profoundly interesting.</p>

      <p>Noah is a 2nd year student in the U.Va. School of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. He is from Alexandria, VA, and has a younger brother and two dogs to keep him company while stuck at home during covid. Currently, he’s working on some pointless but fascinating programming projects, and power-watching <q>Community</q> on Netflix with his family. He’s thrilled to be TAing this semester, and excited to see where the skills he develops as a TA might take him in the future!</p>

      <p>Hello! My name is Will Houghland and I am a 3rd year majoring in CS and Philosophy. I lived in Williamsburg for most of my life and actually worked in Colonial Williamsburg with the Fifes and Drums for about 8 years. More recently, I’ve been passing the time with big open world games (currently on Xenoblade Chronicles) and smaller dives into artistic ideas. I hope to one day either work on general AI or cybersecurity :)</p>

      <p>Hi! My name is Nijat. I am from New York. I like to juggle and play Settlers of Catan with my family (though never both simultaneously). I also enjoy practicing calisthenics and eating sardines. I hope to one day be caressed by the Mediterranean sun while lounging in Sardinia.</p>

      <p>Hey everyone, I’m Liv! I’m a third year math and cs student in the College with the hopes of becoming a federal agent after I graduate. I’m originally from Philly (go Birds), and I have an older sister and one dog. I work a part time internship for a defense government contractor, but in my free time, I love watching football, drawing/painting, and learning new things. Once Covid is over, I would love to travel to Italy, Greece, and Australia.</p>

      <p>Hi, I’m Daniel. I’m in my fourth year studying CS in CAS (the harder school… lol). I’ve spent the COVID-timeline quite productively! Some of my <q>highlights</q>:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Started quarantine season by getting super sick, losing 15 lbs over one week</li>
      <li>Messed around and gained back 35 lbs</li>
      <li>Needed surgery to save my right hand + a concussion to complement it</li>
      <li>Fostered two puppies that I loved more than myself</li>
      <li>Dressed up as Zuko for Halloween (this one was good)</li>
      <li>Was rejected by the love of my life (Amazon)…turns out she was seeing other people</li>
      <li>Decided one concussion wasn’t enough so I doubled down in December just to feel something</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Favorites (of miscellaneous things): Cowboys, Suits, el jefe the works, Sunflower Seeds, Shoe Dog, medium-rare, Chuck+Blair</p>
      <p>if you recognize any and concur, we’ll get along just fine :)</p>

      <p><img src=files/images/tas/kush.jpeg height="300" ></p>
      <p>Hi my name is Kush Patel and this is my third semester as a TA for CS 3102. I’m from Leesburg, VA and am looking forward to graduating this spring with my degree in Computer Science. During the pandemic, I’ve been able to really sharpen my golf and tennis skills with all of the free time that I have had. Once the pandemic has passed, I hope to explore some National Parks around the US. After graduation, I’ll be working for CapTech as a Tech Consultant in their Reston, Va office.</p>
      <h2 data-number="2.15" id="zoe-pham-theythem" data-number="2.15"><span class="header-section-number">2.15</span> Zoe Pham (They/Them)</h2>
      <p><img src=files/images/tas/zoe.png height="300" ></p>
      <p>Zoe is a Posse scholar from Houston, Texas who makes digital art and comics (<a href="tinyurl.com/punkvampsart">tinyurl.com/punkvampsart</a>), and has been playing Hades all of quarantine. They’re looking forward to their first software engineering internship with J.P. Morgan Chase this summer in Plano!</p>
      <h2 data-number="2.16" id="joey-rudek-hehim-or-theythem" data-number="2.16"><span class="header-section-number">2.16</span> Joey Rudek (He/Him or They/Them)</h2>
      <p><img src=files/images/tas/joey.png height="300" ></p>
      <p>Hi! I’m Joey, and I’m a fourth year majoring in computer science and math. I’m pretty big on music: I’ve played piano since I was around two years old, and in high school I participated in the Summer Governor’s School for vocal performance. In college, I’ve taken several music courses, continued composing and arranging, and been a member of the Flying V’s rock a cappella group since my second year. Over quarantine, when I haven’t been banging on my keyboard to play rhythm games, I’ve mostly been getting comfortable with topology, axiomatic set theory, logic, and their respective applications to computer science. (The current cool thing I’m looking at is Boolean algebras and the Stone representation theorem.) Depending on how my applications are received – I just finished submitting most of them – I’ll hopefully be in a CS or logic Ph.D program in the fall.</p>
      <p>I’m a TA for both 3102 and 3330 this semester, and I’m doing computer architecture research as well. If you have any questions about either, or anything you want to know about the CS or math majors, please feel free to ask!</p>
      <h2 data-number="2.17" id="jonah-weissman-hehim" data-number="2.17"><span class="header-section-number">2.17</span> Jonah Weissman (He/Him)</h2>
      <p><img src=files/images/tas/jonah.JPG height="300" ></p>
      <p>I have lived in Charlottesville since I was a little baby. I bake a mean loaf of bread, but I didn’t get into bread making at the start of the pandemic; I waited 6 months to make sure that bread wasn’t just a passing fad. I hope to one day travel to Copenhagen, where I would have gone last summer had study abroad not been cancelled.</p>
