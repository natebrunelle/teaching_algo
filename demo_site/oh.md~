title: Office Hours
...

During our move to online, we will be conducting office hours via [Discord](TODO), using the `#oh` channel. Sign-up instructions will be distributed via email.

We will have scheduled office hours times. If you have content questions outside of office hours, please use the discord channel associated with the relevant week (e.g. `#week3`).


See the calendar below for office hours times:
