# Cohorts

Students in the class will be partitioned into cohorts, small groups
of 5 &ndash; 7 students, who we hope will form effective learning
sub-communities. Each cohort will be expected to work as a group to
help all members succeed, and each individual will be expected to
contribute to their own success as well as the success of the other
members of their cohort.

Cohorts will have two scheduled weekly meetings, one of which will
include a member of the course staff. For the first meeting, students
in the cohort will work together to learn the concepts in the course
and prepare solutions to the assigned problems for the week. Before
the cohort preparation meeting, each student in the cohort will be
expected to study the course materials and to work on these problems
on their own. At the end of a successful cohort preparation meeting,
every student in the cohort should understand all the main ideas from
the course materials for that week, and be able to solve and discuss
the assigned problems.

For the second weekly cohort meeting, a teaching assistant will join
the cohort. The TA will (semi-randomly) select students in the cohort
to present problems from the assigned problem set. The primary
assessment for the course will be how well students do in
demonstrating their understanding and preparation in presenting these
problems. At the end of this meeting, the TA will pick one problem for each
member of the cohort to write up individually, to be submitted at the end of the following day.

The typical weekly schedule for students in the course is below (this
is a representative schedule for a cohort with assessed cohort
meetings on Wednesdays; the schedule will adjust based on which day of
the week the cohort meeting is scheduled):

Day             Activity                              Estimated Time
--------------- ------------------------------------- ---------
Friday          Preparation Materials (Videos)        120 minutes
                Preparation Materials (Readings)      90 minutes
Saturday/Sunday Work on Problem Set (individually)    120 minutes
Monday          Cohort Meeting (without staff)        75 minutes
Tuesday         Complete problem set & Review         60 minutes
Wednesday       Cohort Meeting (with TA)              75 minutes
Thursday        Write-up                              60 minutes
Total Time                                            10 hrs/week

The schedule is designed to expect 10 hours of total work per week,
commensurate with guidelines for a 3-unit course, and we hope this will work best
for most students by spreading the work throughout the week following
a schedule similar to the one above.

Although we have sequentialized the preparation and problem working
efforts, we expect for most students these will be done more
fluidly. It will be valuable to read through the assigned problems at
the beginning of the week, and to attempt to solve problems as you
complete the relevant preparation materials, rather than doing all the
preparation materials first and then approaching the problems.

The actual schedule will vary based on the date of a student's
assessed cohort meeing, and all students are expected to participate
fully in their cohort's scheduled meetings (both the preparation
meeting without staff, and the assessed meeting with the TA).

Students will be assigned to cohorts based on the information you
provide in the beginning-of-course survey. Cohort assignments will be
done around students' provided scheduling constraints.


# Communication Platforms

We will primarily use Discord course announcements and interactive communication. The course web page will be used for course content.

**Course Website:** This is the course website. We will post all instructional materials and logistical information here. 
  
**Kytos Submission System:** We will also
  use a [custom-built Kytos site](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory/) for assignment
  submissions and grading.

**Discord:** We will use the course discord server for most other
  course communications (you will receive information on joining the
  server by email). We expect students to receive messages we send to
  the `#announcements` channel as well as any direct messages we send to you
  on discord. Each cohort will have a channel on the Discord server.

If you have questions about course materials or assignments that will
be relevant to other students, please ask them either in the `#general` channel 
or else in the channel associated with the relevant week (e.g. `#week3`). This will get the fastest response, since all of the course
staff and students will see your question and be able to respond
to it. If you have questions of a personal nature that you only want
to make to the instructor, please use the course discord to contact Professor Brunelle (`@nateb`) in a Direct Message instead of
emailing independently.

**Email:** Managing email for a large class like this is difficult,
  and we prefer to use the course discord for most communications
  relevant to the class. You should feel free to use email for
  messages peripherally related to the course (e.g., emailing an
  instructor about interest in their research). You should also use
  email if you post a question on discord but don't receive an adequate
  response within 24 hours.


# Grading

We hope that you can spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade. That said, we understand students are often
stressed about grading and understandably want to know where they
stand in a class without having to rely just on the judgment of the
course staff.  We aim to grade in a way that is useful (provides
students with accurate measure of how well they understood what they
should), motivating (encourages the behaviors we prefer, including
hard but not obsessive work), fair (assigned higher grades to more
deserving students), robust (arbitrary small perturbations do not have
a material impact on someone's grade), and low stress (for both
students and the course staff).

Each student's final grade will be determined by two components: and Individual grade and a community grade. The individual grade is intended to assess how well a student understands the course content, and determines the letter of a student's grade (e.g. A, B, C, etc.). The Community grade is intended to assess how well the student contributed their cohort, and determines the modifier of a student's letter grade (e.g. +, -, neutral). For example, a student who demonstrates substantial understanding of course concepts, but was not an effective member of their cohort would receive a grade of A-, a student with moderate understanding of course concepts and contributed much to their cohort might receive a B+.


## Individual Grades

Your individual grade will be determined by 2 components:

- [**Assessed Cohort Meetings**](structure.html#assessed): TAs will provide a score after each assessed cohort meeting to reflect how well you understood content from that week.
- [**Writeups**](structure.html#writeups): In order to ensure you are able to communicate ideas in writing, each week you will be asked to write up one problem (as assigned during your Assessed Cohort Meeting).


We will have 12 assessed cohort meetings during the semester with 60 total points available for full credit (3 points for each week's assessed cohort meeting, 2 points for each week's writeup). The individual grade for students will be based on this
scale:

Individual Grade Cohort+Writeup Points
---------------- ---------------------
A                51
B                42
C                36

With the exception of cases of academic dishonesty or inappropriate
behavior, we guarantee that you will at least receive the minimum
letter grade given in the table (possibly modified by a <b>-</b> based
on the community grading described below), but you may be assigned a
higher grade based on your overall performance and showing improvement
over the course of the semester.

In cases where a student's grade is not clear based on their cohort
assessments, we will provide option for students to request an oral
final exam to be scheduled with one of the instructors during the exam
period.


### Assessed Cohort Meetings  {#assessed}

The main assessment will be based on students
performance in the weekly cohort meetings.  Each student will be
evaluated based on how well they are able to present problems at these
meetings. It is not necessary or expected that students can solve
every problem or have a complete solution, and the cohort meetings are
meant more for learning than assessment, but it is expected that every
student in the cohort is prepared to discuss every problem in the
assigned problem set.

Students will be assigned a grade based on their performance at the
cohort meeting on this scale (fractional grades are possible):

Grade Meaning
----- -------
3     Able to present on the selected problem well and to demonstrate good understanding of key concepts.
2     Able to demonstrate some understanding of key concepts and preparation effort, but not able to make progress on the selected problem.
1     Showed some understanding of the concepts needed to solve the selected problem, but not well prepared or able to make steps towards a reasonable solution.
0     Not able to contribute to the cohort meeting.



### Writeups {#writeups}

Each week your cohort coach will assign a problem from the weekly problem set to writeup. Each student will writeup this problem individually. You may reference notes you and your cohort-mates compiled prior to the assessed cohort meeting, but you may not collaborate on the writeup after the assessed meeting has occurred.

Students will be assigned a grade based on the quality of their writeup according to this scale (fractional grades are possible:

Grade Meaning
----- -------
2     Writeup correctly solves the problem with a clearly-presented description.
1.5   Writeup is nearly complete, but may have minor misconceptions.
1     Writeup is correct except for major misconceptions.
0.5   Writeup conveys some understanding of relevant concepts, but little progress is made towards a complete solution.
0     Writeup has little similarity to a complete and correct solution.



## Community Grades {#community}

In addition to the individual cohort assessment
  grades, each cohort will receive a community grade based on how well
  the cohort does as a group, and how well a student contibutes to their cohort. This evaluation will determined whether a student receives a plus (+), minus (-) or neutral version of their individually-assigned letter grade.

Two main factors will contribute to the community grade:

- **Overall performance of the cohort during assessed cohort meetings:** Doing well on this depends on all members of the cohort
  being prepared to present problems well. This will be determined
  based on the sum of the individual cohort assessments, the weekly
  individual minimum individual cohort assessment, the trend of
  these values over the semester, and feedback from your cohort coach.

- **Peer Evaluations:** In most cases the community score will be the same among all students in a cohort. We will utilize periodic evaluations to facilate feedback among cohort members, and identify members who are exceeding or falling short of community expectations. Evaluations are intended to act as status checks, and will not directly impact a student's grade. At the end of the semester we will look for *trends* in several evaluations to identify consistently outstanding community members and those with longstanding issues with community engagement.
