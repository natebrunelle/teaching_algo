title: Week 12 Guide
...

Wow, the final week - **congratulations!**

This week is different from previous weeks: there is no new technical
content, and no cohort problems.

Instead, the goal of this week is for you to do something that either
synthesizes a key idea from the class, or explores a topic of your
choice related to theoretical computer science.

Although it will be sufficient to earn full credit this week to do
something that just benefits your own understanding, we hope some of
you will produce artifacts that will have value beyond this.

# Collaboration Options

For this assignment, we want to give you an opportunity to share what you've learned this semester with members of another cohort. Each cohort has been matched with one or more "sibling" cohorts. Your sibling cohort(s) will meet on the same schedule (assessed and prep cohort meetings on the same day, but not necessarily the same time). You have three collaboration options for this week's task:

1) You may complete the assignment alone (group of size 1)
1) You may work as a pair, with your partner being assigned from one of your sibling cohorts (group of size 2)
1) You may form a group with 2-3 total members of your cohort to be matched with a partner group from a sibling cohort (group of size 4-6)

You should inform your cohort coach of your group arrangement preference no later than the first day of week 12 for you (i.e. the day after your week 11 writeup is due). If you have not given your preference by that time then we will assume you are working solo. You will be informed of your sibling cohort partners on the following day.

The expectations for quality and value of your submission scale according to the square root of the number of members in a group (so
if you have a group of six you would be expected to do something at least sqrt(6) = 2.45... as impressive as what an individual would do working alone).

# Schedule

The schedule will follow the normal schedule, with the exception that you need to declare your cohort partitioning by the first day of Week 12 write-up deadline. During your prep meeting you should share your project idea with your cohort mates so that you can get some early feedback. If you're working in a group, you will likely need to plan additional meetings with your group to work on the assignment.

You will present what you accomplished to your cohort members and your cohort coach during your normal assess cohort meeting time. Your presentation should mention what theory concepts you have included and who the target audience is.

# Video

There's only one video for Week 12 &mdash; a course wrap-up that recaps the main themes we've seen in cs3102:

<p>Main Themes of the Course (12:22) <br><iframe width='800' height='450' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zBm0fdrwLHY' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe><br></p>

(You won't be asked questions about this in the cohort meetings, but
we do hope you'll find it worthwhile.)

# Assignment

**Create an artifact that conveys some idea related to this class.**

Your artifact can be anything you want, so long as it includes some
representation as a finite sequence of bits that can be posted on the
Internet. Examples of possible artifacts include a written story, a
comic, a video, a song (lyrics), or an interpretive dance.

If your artifact cannot be posted on the Internet (for example, if you
bake lasagna, build a quantum computer, or develop a time machine) you
should still make some description of your artifact (including a video
or pictures if helpful) that can be posted.

# Target Audience

You can define your target audience but should specify what it
is. Examples of target audiences include “five year olds”, “typical
third graders”, “your parents”, "professional programmers without
formal CS background", “UVa students majoring in history”, “Martians”,
“cs1110 students”, or "future cs3102 students".

# Evaluation Criteria

At the Week 12 assessed cohort meeting, you will present your artifact
to your cohort, and your Cohort Leader (and cohortmates) may ask
questions about it. 

Your artifact will be evaluated on technical correctness and perceived
effectiveness in conveying an important idea to your defined target
audience. Aesthetic merit, entertainment value, production quality,
and creativity are also important, but only in as much as they support
the goal of conveying an idea related to theoretical computer science
to your target audience.

Particularly impressive projects may receive extra credit.

# Example Submissions

We don't want to limit your creativity, but here are some examples
from previous courses for a similar assignments.
