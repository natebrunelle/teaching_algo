# Course Description

The goal of this course is to build a tool kit to better solve a variety of computational problems, and to evaluate the quality of such solutions. In particular, we will cover:

- Formal metrics for evaluating algorithm complexity (including the asymptotic classes big-oh, big-omega, big-theta, little-oh, and little-omega)
- Evaluating an algorithm's usage of resources (including time and space complexities) by a worst-case analysis, expected-case analysis, and amortized analysis
- Algorithm design strategies (including divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, and reductions)
- The impact of data-structure choice on algorithm design
- Proving algorithm correctness
- Proving worst-case lower bounds on algorithm efficiency
- Discussion of randomized algorithms and expected efficiency
- Algorithms on graphs
- NP-Completeness

## Learning Outcomes

At the conclusion of this course, a successful student will be able to:

- Analyze a pre-written algorithm to determine its resource complexity
- Employ the strategies of divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming (perhaps in concert) to develop novel algorithms
- Prove the correctness of algorithms built using these strategies
- Identify trade-offs in algorithm design (such as time vs. space, average-case vs. worst case, dynamic vs. static)
- Prove lower bounds on algorithm complexity

## Background

This course will assume knowledge of several topics from discrete math (CS2102 at UVA), two semesters of programming experience (through CS2110 at UVA), and data structures (CS2150 at UVA)

In particular, we assume elementary knowledge of:

- Logarithms and identities 
- Sets 
- Functions 
- Proof Techniques 
- Proof Styles
- Logic and Notation
- Recursion 
- Trees
- Queues
- Stacks
- Priority Queues
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

# Unit 0: Course Introduction

In the first lecture I cover:

- A definition of the work "algorithm"
- Two algorithms for computing pi, including a discussion for how we can compare the "quality" of the two algorithms
- A paralellizable algorithm for taking attendance
- What to expect in the course

I also typically cover course logistics and some syllabus content. Those have been omitted from the video below.
