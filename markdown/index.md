# Course Description

  The goal of this course is to understand the
  fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed in our
  universe and other possible (or imaginary) universes. These limits
  reveal deep and mysterious properties about information,
  communication, and computing, as well as practical issues about how
  to solve problems.


Two fundamental questions about any problem are:
 
 1. _Can it be solved using a machine of a certain type?_ (computability)
 2. _How much does it cost to solve it?_ (complexity)
 
We explore these questions by developing abstract models of computing
machines and reasoning about what they can and cannot compute
efficiently.  We will also look at some applications in cryptography
that take advantage of problems being hard to solve, and what can be
done when a problem cannot be solved or is too expensive to solve.

# Course Objectives

Students who complete the course will:

- Improve their [mathematical thinking skill and
  habits](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/habits-of-highly-mathematical-people-b719df12d15e),
  including thinking precisely about definitions, stating assumptions
  carefully, critically reading arguments, and being able to write
  convincingly.

- Be able to understand both finite and infinite formal models of computation and to reason about what they can and cannot compute.
- Understand both intuitively and formally what makes some problems too expensive to solve, and what can be done in practice when an unsolvable or intractable problem is encountered.
- Reason formally about the cost of computation, and be able to prove useful bounds on the costs of solving problems, including showing that certain problems are intractable.
- Learn about some interesting aspects of theoretical computer science, including cryptography and machine learning.


## Eligibility

**Official Prerequisites:** CS 2102 and CS 2110 (or comparable
  courses) with grades of at least a C- (if taken for a grade) or CR (if taken using the COVID Credit/No Credit option). (We will waive this
  prerequisite for students who convince us that they satisfy the
  expected background below.)
  

## Background

This course will assume knowledge of several topics from discrete math (CS2102 at UVA), and object-oriented Java programming (taught in CS2110 at UVA).

In particular, we assume knowledge of (with recommended resources for review):

- Sets ([CS2102 Sets Primer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/sets.html))
- Functions ([Section 4.3 of this text](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/files/mcs.pdf))
- Proof Techniques ([CS2102 Proof Techniques](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/techniques-q8.html))
- Proof Styles, we'll mostly be using "prose proofs" ([CS2102 Proof style guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/proofs.html))
- Logic and Notation ([CS2102 Glossary of logical terms](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/glossary.html))
- Java Programming ([Java wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming))

For each of the CS2102 topics, you can view last [semester's lectures](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/F2019/schedule.html) for more information
